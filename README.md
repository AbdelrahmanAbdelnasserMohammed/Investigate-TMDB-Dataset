*Variables of Interest*
<ul>

### Conclusions

A. Using this data set, I managed to extract top movie directors performing in certain movies genres

B. To Understand the factors that achieve higher movie revenues, I examine two factors:

B.1: Movie Genre: 

I found that Action & Science fiction movies achieve more average revenues than others.

B.2: Producing Companies: 

I first extracted the top ten companies producing more movies. Then I examine its average budget. Then, I examined the company with the highst difference between the average budget and revenue to figure out the movie genres it mostly produce.
